This is a Scrabble helper. Currently only in Finnish, but I may add other languages.

This helper allows you keep track of how many letter tiles are left in your game of Scrabble.

Using the helper:

- click on a letter tile to reduce the count of a letter and total amount by one
- the count of each letter is represented in the box underneath its letter tile, and the amount of tiles left is shown below the header
- if you accidentally click on a letter tile, you can add to the count by clicking on the box underneath a tile
